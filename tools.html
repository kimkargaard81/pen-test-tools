The content will be divided into the different sections that make up a penetration test, which are:
1. Reconnaissance/Information Gathering
2. Scanning & Enummeration
3. Exploitation
4. Maintaining Access
5. Covering Tracks (cleaning up). 

All the tools can be used to assist in a penetration test, although one does not need to use them all in all cases. 

1. Reconnaissance 

Reconnaissance is actually made up of two different parts, Active and Passive Reconnaissance. Passive essentially means any information gathering that does not hit the servers of the company.
We might be looking for physical things like the office layout, the security around the office, what the office access card looks like, who the employees are, what they do, email addresses etc.
All this information can be found without actually hitting the servers. In this phase it would also be useful to find any sub domains etc. 

Active information gathering is when we actually hit the servers, and sort of moves into the second phase of the penetration test, which is scanning. 

For finding email addresses:
<a href="https://hunter.io/">Hunter.io</a>
<a href="https://phonebook.cz/">Phonebook</a>
Clearbit - a Google Chrome plugin - works in Gmail
<a href="https://tools.emailhippo.com/">Verify if an email is active</a>
<a href="https://email-checker.net/validate">Verify if an email is active</a>

We need to find breached date and we can use different tools to find email addresses and passwords used by employees of a company online on other services. If we can find users that have used the same/similar passwords on different external systems, then we can use those on the company systems (with modifications). 

https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse - this can be used to find breached user/password combinations found on the darknet. Note that the file is really big. 
https://www.dehashed.com/ - a great tool to search for usernames, passwords, linked email accounts etc. This is a really powerful tool and can help us to find passwords that we can use and to link account and users to other accounts.
https://hashes.com/en/decrypt/hash - use it to crack hashes that you find on dehashed.com
https://github.com/Rog3rSm1th/Profil3r - a potential tool to use that could be used instead of dehashed
