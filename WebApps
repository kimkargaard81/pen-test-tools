1. Web Application Enumeration

Note, this is once we have done the initial information gathering step in a pen test.

We need to have Go installed. https://github.com/Dewalt-arch/pimpmykali

AssetFinder

install Assetfinder https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder

syntax: go get -u github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder
right, now we can use Assetfinder to find sub domains. 

syntax: assetfinder domain.com > output.txt
This is really fast. It is worth noting that is not only finds sub domains, but also assets that might belong to or are owned by the company. 
If we just want subdomains, we can run:

syntax: assetfinder --subs-only domainname > output.txt

Amass - an OWASP tool 
Should be installed on Kali already. It is very slow. 

syntax: amass enum -d domainname

HTTPprobe 

useful to check if sites are up. 

GoWitness

https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness - for screenshots of websites

Note that GoWitness needs at least version 1.16 of Golang installed (at the moment) to run and needs Chromium installed on Kali to actually work. 

An automation script is available called run.sh which will automatically run against a domain and do all of the above, plus run an nmap scan and more.
