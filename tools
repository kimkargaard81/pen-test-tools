The content will be divided into the different sections that make up a penetration test, which are:
1. Reconnaissance/Information Gathering
2. Scanning & Enummeration
3. Exploitation
4. Maintaining Access
5. Covering Tracks (cleaning up). 

All the tools can be used to assist in a penetration test, although one does not need to use them all in all cases.
